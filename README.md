# NALMS-2019 

## Background 

This repository contains the code used to create the `R Shiny` apps that were used in my talk, *Telling the story of Indiana lake water quality with interactive web-based mapping and data visualization*.  The talk was presented at the 39th International Symposium of the North American Lake Management Society in Burlington, VT on November 12, 2019.  

The sections below provide a brief description of what each web application does and how you can find the materials to recreate and interact with each app.  

Each folder in this repository contains all code/data/images that correspond to each app. My slides can also be found in the `slides` folder. 

## App 1 - Data distributions 

App 1 allows the user to generate frequency distributions, summary statistics, and tabulated data for water quality parameters contained in the *Indiana Lake Water Quality Assessment Report for 2015-2018*.  In addition, both plot and table outputs are able to be downloaded as .png and .csv files, respectively.  The `App_1_Distributions` folder contains the files used to render the app.  The web version for the app can be found [here](https://corysauve.shinyapps.io/nalms_app_1/).  Please note that this app is under development and is currently hosted on a limited use server.

## App 2 - Lake Type Aggregations 

App 2 allows the user to aggregate data from the *Indiana Lake Water Quality Assessment Report for 2015-2018* by lake type and generate boxplots, summary statistics, and tabulated data.  In addition, both plot and table outputs are able to be downloaded as .png and .csv files, respectively.  The `App_2_LakeType` folder contains the files used to render the app. Please note that this app is under development and is currently hosted on a limited use server.

## App 3 - Ecoregion Aggregations 

App 3 allows the user to aggregate data from the *Indiana Lake Water Quality Assessment Report for 2015-2018* by ecoregion and generate boxplots, summary statistics, and tabulated data.  In addition, both plot and table outputs are able to be downloaded as .png and .csv files, respectively.  The `App_3_Ecoregion` folder contains the files used to render the app. Please note that this app is under development and is currently hosted on a limited use server.  

## App 4 - Dashboard 

App 4 provides an interactive dashboard for the *Indiana Lake Water Quality Assessment Report for 2015-2018*.  The dashboard provides all output from App 1, 2, and 3.  The user can also generate data requests from the entire report dataset and produce customized reports for a specific lake.  The `App_4_Dashboard` folder contains the files used to render the app. Please note that this app is under development and is currently hosted on a limited use server.
