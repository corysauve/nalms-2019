# NALMS-2019 

## Background 

This repository contains the code used to create the `R Shiny` apps that were used in my talk, *Telling the story of Indiana lake water quality with interactive web-based mapping and data visualization*.  The talk was presented at the 39th International Symposium of the North American Lake Management Society in Burlington, VT on November 12, 2019.  

The sections below provide a brief description of what each web application does and how you can find the materials to recreate and interact with each app.  

Each folder in this repository contains all code/data/images that correspond to each app. My slides can also be found in the `slides` folder. 

## App 1 - Data distributions 

App 1 allows the user to create frequency distributions, summary statistics, and tabulated data for water quality parameters contained in the *Indiana Lake Water Quality Assessment Report for 2015-2018*.  The `App_1_Distributions` folder contains the files used to render the app.  The web version for the app can be found [here](https://corysauve.shinyapps.io/nalms_app_1/).  Please note that this app is under development and is currently hosted on a limited use server.  

## App 2 - Lake Type Aggregations 



## App 3 - Ecoregion Aggregations
